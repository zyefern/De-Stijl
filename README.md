De-Stijl
========

A interactive webpage that recreates a De Stijl type of artwork

Uses jQuery, jQuery UI, and a handy script for touch screen support.

Touch script for jQuery UI: http://touchpunch.furf.com/

TO DO:
 •Test touch on tablets and smart phones
 •Improve "clear all" to check for boxes before alerting
 •maybe use onClick rather than jQuery's click function
